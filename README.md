# zplot

Welcome to zplot. 

If you just want to use zplot, a reasonably recent version is available 
via pip (e.g., "pip install zplot").

If you want to hack on it, you can clone it/etc. from github
(e.g., "git clone https://github.com/z-plot/z-plot").

As for the files found within this repo:

The source code for zplot is stored simply here:
  zplot/zplot.py

The docs are found here:
  docs/ 

Most of these are auto-generated from zplot.py and the existing examples. If
you wish to understand how they are generated, start with docs/Makefile and go
from there. Type "make" in the docs/ directory to build the docs.

Examples are found in here:
  examples/ 

Each sub-directory contains a number of examples of different types of plots. 
Many of these are inspired from examples on the ploticus website 
(http://ploticus.sourceforge.net/doc/welcome.html)
