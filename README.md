# zplot

Welcome to zplot. 

The source code is stored simply in one place: zplot/zplot.py
Could you put this into multiple files? Sure, but we didn't.

The docs are found in docs/ and are auto-generated. Go into
that directory and type "make" to make the documents.

Examples are found in the examples/ directory.
