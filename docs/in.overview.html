<h2> Abstract</h2>
<p>
We introduce Zplot, a Python library for making two-dimensional data
plots.  Zplot provides a simple set of primitives that allow users to input
and manipulate data, plot said data in a variety of formats, and decorate the
resulting graphs with axes, labels, and other textual accents. Zplot then
outputs encapsulated PostScript for ease of inclusion in technical documents;
rudimentary support for SVG is also provided.
</p>

<h2> Introduction</h2>
<p> 
Zplot is a simple Python library that allows the creation of two-dimensional
data graphics in a flexible and powerful manner. Typical graphs are created
with only a few lines of code, and complex and intricate graphs can be
produced from only tens of lines of code. Additionally, because Zplot
graph-creation is simply Python, one can bring to bear all the power of
programming to create visualizations. Repetitive tasks can be performed in
loops, and useful primitives can be encapsulated in functions.
</p>

<p> In this document, we describe Zplot. First, we give an overview of the
tool and the basic primitives it provides. Then, we describe each of the basic
routines in more detail, showing how they can be combined to produce a wide
range of interesting graphs. Zplot drawing routines are all built upon a set
of low-level PostScript-generating commands (there is also a new SVG driver);
these commands hide many of the details of generating correct PostScript (or
SVG) from the rest of Zplot, boiling down most activities to simple drawing
commands that place lines, shapes, and text on the drawing surface.
</p> 

<h2> Overview</h2>

<p>
We now describe the basic primitives provided by Zplot. Let us start with a
typical (if simple) graph as an example, and use this to drive the discussion
of the different elements of Zplot. A typical graphing script might be written
as follows:

<blockquote>
<pre>
# import the library
from zplot import *

# describe the drawing surface
c = postscript(title='example1.eps', dimensions=['3in', '2.4in'])

# load some data
t = table(file='example1.data')

# make a drawable region for a graph
d = drawable(canvas=c, xrange=[0,10], yrange=[0,10],
             coord=['0.5in','0.4in'], dimensions=['2.3in','1.7in'])

# make some axes
axis(drawable=d, title='A Sample Graph', xtitle='The X-Axis',
     ytitle='The Y-Axis')

# plot the points
p = plotter()
p.points(drawable=d, table=t, xfield='x', yfield='y', style='triangle',
         linecolor='red', fill=True, fillcolor='red')

# finally, output the graph to a file
c.render()
</pre>
</blockquote>

<b> Figure 1:</b> The most bare-boned of plots that one can make with Zplot.
</center>
</p>

<p>
The EPS version of this graph is
shown <a href="../examples/original-paper/example1.eps"> here;</a> it is made
from <a href="../examples/original-paper/example1.data"> this data set</a>
using <a href="../examples/original-paper/example1.py"> this script.</a>
</p>

<p> In this example, the user creates a graph by first describing the drawing
surface by creating a <a href="postscript.html">postscript object</a> and
specifying its dimensions. Then, the user creates a <a href="table.html">table
object</a> to load data from a file, getting the data from a file
file.data. The user, wishing to plot the data, now creates a drawable region
by creating a <a href="drawable.html">drawable object</a>; doing so defines
where on the canvas the drawable is, and also how to map data points onto the
drawing surface (e.g., the range of x values and y values that map onto this
drawable); note that interesting graphs can use more than one drawable to
great effect. With a drawable defined, the user can create
a <a href="plotter.html"> plotter object</a>, call one of a variety of
plotting routines (e.g., <a href="plotter.html#points">points()</a>) to plot
the data onto the drawable. The plotting routines generally take a large
number of arguments, enabling a wide variety of plots to be produced; in this
case, the user chooses to draw a red triangle at each (x,y) point of the
graph. Finally, the user adds some graphical and textual decorations to help
clarify the graph (in this case, by simply creating
an <a href="axis.html">axis object</a>), and then renders the PostScript to a
file by calling the <a href="postscript.html#render">render()</a> method of
the postscript object.  We now describe each of these primitives in more
detail.
</p> 

<p> 
Note that each of these routines takes a large number of optional parameters.
Read more about them in the documentation page.
</p> 

<h2> Tables</h2>

<p> There are numerous routines available to users to input and manipulate
data; these are found in the <a href="table.html">table object</a> and related
methods. The most commonly used approach is simply to create a table object
and pass in a file name; creating a table in this way will read the file into
memory and thus make it ready to be plotted. A typical data file (such 
as <a href="../examples/original-paper/example1.data"> example1.data</a>
above) looks like this:

<p> 
<pre>
# x y
0 0
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 6
...
9 4
10 8
</pre>
</p> 

<p> 
The first line contains the <b>schema</b> for the table, with names for each
column; these names are subsequently used to refer to the data when
manipulating it or drawing it to the screen. If no schema is specified, one
can simply refer to each column by the names 'c0', 'c1', and so forth. The
default is to use whitespace as a separator; however, one can specify a
different separator (such as a comma or colon) as need be.
</p> 

<p> 
One powerful aspect of tables in zplot is that they utilize SQLite; this
allows one to perform database-like selections over data and thus subset and
manipulate data readily. Here is an example that selects data from a table 
with y-values above 5 by creating a new table <code>thi</code>, and plots
green circles around said points (the results of which are shown in the figure
linked below). 
</p> 

<p> 
<pre>
# load some data
t = table(file='example2.data')
thi = table(table=t, where='y > 5')

...

# plot the points
p = plotter()
p.points(drawable=d, table=t, xfield='x', yfield='y', style='triangle',
         linecolor='red', fill=True, fillcolor='red')
p.points(drawable=d, table=thi, xfield='x', yfield='y', style='circle',
         linecolor='green', size='5', linewidth=2)
</pre>
</p>

<img width=216 height=172.8 
src="../examples/original-paper/example2.svg"></img></a><br></br>
<b> Figure 2: Table Selection.</b> The example uses a simple table
selection to find y-values that are greater than 5. Then, these
points are plotted as green circles.
</center>
</p>


<p> This example is shown in
postscript <a href="../examples/original-paper/example2.eps"> here;</a> it is
made from <a href="../examples/original-paper/example2.data"> this data
set</a> using <a href="../examples/original-paper/example2.py"> this
script.</a>
</p> 

<p> There are a number of other useful table functions which are not covered
here, mostly for manipulating and summarizing data; see <a href="table.html">
the table method APIs</a> for more information. For example,
the <a href="table.html#update">update()</a> method allows arbitrary SQL
updates to be performed.
</p> 

<h2>Drawable</h2>

<p> The drawable is likely the most important abstraction that Zplot
implements. A drawable is created by instantiating a <a href="drawable.html">
drawable object. </a> The powerful aspect of a drawable is that it enables a
user to place multiple (potentially overlapping) drawable regions onto the
drawing surface. This feature can be used to implement a number of interesting
graphs. For example, in the figure below (Figure 5 in this 
a <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Publications/dgraid-fast04.pdf">FAST
paper</a>), two regions of the graph are of interest but hard to see due to
their small size. Thus, one can create two additional drawables and plot
closeups of the data in those regions. 
</p> 

<p>
<center>
<a href="../examples/original-paper/dgraid.svg">
<img width="400" height="290" src="../examples/original-paper/dgraid.svg">
</img>
</a><br></br>
<b> Figure 3: Nested Plots.</b> A plot from an earlier paper of ours
is recreated. Two closeups are made in the lower graph, with
only a few lines of Python code required.
</center>
</p>

<p> The FAST paper graph can be
seen <a href="../examples/original-paper/dgraid.eps"> here;</a> it is made
from <a href="../examples/original-paper/dgraid.copy.data"> this file</a>
and <a href="../examples/original-paper/dgraid.nocopy.data"> this file</a>
using <a href="../examples/original-paper/dgraid.py"> this script.</a>  Two
closeups are made in the lower graph, with only a few lines of code required
to do so.
</p> 

<p> This example also demonstrates a number of parameters that the drawable
object can be passed when creating it. For example, a user can specify its
exact position with the <code>coord</code> parameter and its size with the
<code>dimensions</code> parameter.
</p>

</a><br></br>
<b> Figure 4: Multiple Y Axes.</b> The script creates two drawables,
the right one with a y-range that is twice as high as the
left one. The same data is plotted on both.
</center>
</p>

<p> Multiple drawables can also be used to plot data with multiple y axes in a
simple and straightforward manner. In this example, we plot the same data from
the example above, except onto an overlapping drawable that maps the y range
from 0 up to 20 (instead of 0 to 10). 
<p> This third example is
shown <a href="../examples/original-paper/example3.eps"> here;</a> it is made
from <a href="../examples/original-paper/example3.data"> this data set</a>
using <a href="../examples/original-paper/example3.py"> this script</a> (this
script is also shown below).  The script creates two drawables, the right one
with a y-range that is twice as high as the left one. The same data is plotted
on both drawables, but with different scales.
</p> 


<p> 
<pre>
# import the library
from zplot import *

# describe the drawing surface
c = postscript(title='example3.eps', dimensions=['3.3in', '2.4in'])

# load some data
t = table(file='example3.data')

# make a drawable region for a graph
d1 = drawable(canvas=c, xrange=[0,10], yrange=[0,10],
             coord=['0.5in','0.4in'], dimensions=['2.3in','1.7in'])
d2 = drawable(canvas=c, xrange=[0,10], yrange=[0,20],
             coord=['0.5in','0.4in'], dimensions=['2.3in','1.7in'])

# make some axes
axis(drawable=d1, title='A Sample Graph', xtitle='The X-Axis',
     ytitle='The Y-Axis')
axis(drawable=d2, style='y', title='', ytitle='The Second Y-Axis',
     yaxisposition=10, yauto=[0,20,4], labelstyle='in', ticstyle='in')

# plot the points
p = plotter()
p.points(drawable=d1, table=t, xfield='x', yfield='y', style='triangle',
         linecolor='red', fill=True, fillcolor='red')
p.points(drawable=d2, table=t, xfield='x', yfield='y', style='triangle',
         linecolor='green', fill=True, fillcolor='green')
    
# finally, output the graph to a file
c.render()
</pre>
</p> 

<h2> The Plotter Object</h2>

<p> 

The <a href="plotter.html"> plotter object</a> is used to plot data onto
drawables. It provides numerous plotting methods to get this job done:
<ul>
<li> <a href="plotter.html#points"> points()</a>, which plots points onto a drawable</li>
<li> <a href="plotter.html#line"> line()</a>, which plots a line</li>
<li> <a href="plotter.html#horizontalbars"> horizontalbars()</a>, which can be
  used to make horizontal bar graphs</li>
<li> <a href="plotter.html#verticalbars"> verticalbars()</a>, which can be
  used to make vertical bar graphs </li>
<li> <a href="plotter.html#horizontalintervals"> horizontalintervals()</a>,
  which can make short intervals (lines between two points, perhaps to show
  confidence intervals) in a horizontal direction</li>
<li> <a href="plotter.html#verticalintervals"> verticalintervals()</a>, as
  above, but in the vertical direction</li>
<li> <a href="plotter.html#verticalfill"> verticalfill()</a>, which can
  create a filled graph (as one would use in a stacked line graph)</li>
<li> <a href="plotter.html#function"> function()</a>, which can plot an
  arbitrary function over an interval</li>
<li> <a href="plotter.html#heat"> heat()</a>, which can make a heat map
  (a form of a 3D graph)</li>
</ul>

<b> Figure 5: Multiple Plot Types.</b> This example plots a number
of different plot types, as described in each title. Of course, many
other variations are possible.
</center>
</p>


<p>
This next example, shown in Figure 5 above, presents a number of different
possibilities from the above, all combined into a single script. The EPS graph
is shown <a href="../examples/original-paper/example-multi.eps"> here;</a> it
is made from <a href="../examples/original-paper/example-multi.data"> this
data set</a> using <a href="../examples/original-paper/example-multi.py"> this
script.</a> One interesting point is that multiple types from above can be
combined to make more interesting plots; for example, a box-and-whiskers type
plot is simply a combination of vertical intervals, vertical bars, and points.
</p>

<p> Another example plots a number of different patterns in a set of
stacked bars. As one can see, patterns such as diagonal lines and triangles
can be used to fill a region, allowing for the creation of bar graphs with
many different types of data within. The example is
  shown <a href="../examples/original-paper/example4.eps"> here;</a> it is
  made from <a href="../examples/original-paper/example4.data"> this data 
set</a> using <a href="../examples/original-paper/example4.py"> this
    script.</a>

<b> Figure 6: Multiple Patterns.</b> 
This example plots a number of different patterns in a set of stacked bars. As
one can see, patterns such as diagonal lines and triangles can be used to fill
a region. The example also includes a legend.
</center>
</p>



<h2>Axes, Tics, and Labels</h2>

<p>
A single complex object supports the generation of axes, tic marks, and labels
for a graph. It is (not surprisingly) called the <a href="axis.html">axis
object</a>. It has too many arguments to describe here in any detail; see
the <a href="axis.html"> documentation page</a> for details. However, it is
often quite simple to use. For example, to specify the title, label for the
x-axis, and label for the y-axis, one simple do the following:
</p> 

<p> 
<pre>
axis(drawable=d, title='Title', xtitle='X-Axis', ytitle='Y-Axis')
</pre>
</p> 

<p> Internal algorithms compute reasonable locations for said labels
(depending on whether tic marks are used, for example). Further, when the
guesses are wrong, one can use a shift argument to move the text to a more
appropriate location (e.g., the <b>titleshift</b> argument can be passed the
value [3,0] to bump it 3 points to the right). Many of the other options deal
with customizations such as font selection, rotation, color, and so forth.
</p> 


<h2>Legend</h2>

<p>
Finally, Zplot provides support in most plotting routines for the addition of
a legend via a legend object; see documentation <a href="legend.html">
here.</a> Each given plot method (such
as <a href="plotter.html#line">line()</a>) takes an optional <b>legend</b>
parameter which specifies the legend object, and a <b>legendtext</b> parameter
which indicates the name to be associated with the data. The script should
subsequently call the <a href="legend.html#draw">draw()</a> method to place
the legend on the screen and control its appearance.
This <a href="../examples/original-paper/example4.py"> script</a> contains the
following example (some lines omitted for brevity):
</p> 

<p>
<pre>
...
L = legend()

p = plotter()
p.verticalbars(drawable=d, table=b5, xfield='x', yfield='y', fill=True, 
               fillcolor='darkgray', bgcolor='white', barwidth=0.9, legend=L,
               legendtext='Stuff', linewidth=0.5)
...
L.draw(canvas=c, coord=d.map([6,8]), down=True, width=15, height=15)
c.render()
</pre>
</p>


<h2>PostScript Generation</h2>

<p>
Zplot is built on top of a number of underlying canvas primitives. Two types
of canvases are currently supported: a <a href="postscript.html"> postscript
object</a> and a (currently rudimentary) <a href="svg.html"> svg object</a>,
which output graphs in postscript and SVG formats respectively.  The former is
useful for inclusion in LaTeX papers, whereas the latter can be useful for web
pages. Each of these provide the basic ability to draw shapes as well as place
text into the figure the user is making. Furthermore, the primitives provided
by the canvases are used by the plotting routines and thus make said plotting
code canvas-neutral.
</p> 

<p> One method found in these classes is <a href="postscript.html#line">
<code>line()</code></a>, which lets the user draw a line directly on the
canvas.  The method is passed a set of coordinates, some basic information
about the line, and then produces a line that connects the coordinates in the
resulting PostScript. All PostScript (and SVG) primitives take coordinates in
PostScript <i>ems</i>, each of which is 1/72nd of an inch.  The line method
takes additional arguments that allow the addition of an arrow to the end of
the line; we omit these parameters for the sake of space;
see <a href="postscript.html#line"> this</a> for more information.
</p> 

<p> An example of some of the subtle differences in lines is
shown <a href="../examples/original-paper/example-psline.eps"> here;</a> it is
made using <a href="../examples/original-paper/example-psline.py"> this
script.</a>
</p> 

<p> There are a few other raw drawing methods, such as 
<a href="postscript.html#box"> <code>box()</code></a>,
<a href="postscript.html#arc"> <code>arc()</code></a>,
<a href="postscript.html#circle"> <code>circle()</code></a>,
<a href="postscript.html#polygon"> <code>polygon()</code></a>, all of which
make the shape one might expect.
</p>

Each of these shape routines take a variety of arguments that describe their
coordinates, and then all take three different sets of arguments that
characterize the line around the shape (e.g., <code>linewidth, linejoin,
linecap, linedash</code>), the fill of the shape (<code>fill,
fillstyle</code>), and the background color behind any non-solid fill pattern
(<code>bgcolor</code>). The line descriptors match those of
the <code>line()</code> method above, and the background color is
straightforward. Most interesting, then, is the variety and flexibility
provided by the pattern descriptions.
</p> 

<p> Parameters further allow users to specify a fill pattern for a region. The
most important parameter is <code>fillstyle</code>, which determines how the
region is filled. Current styles that are supported include <code>solid,
hline, vline, dline1, dline2, circle, square, triangle, utriangle</code>; more
are added from time to time. Each pattern takes two arguments to determine its
contents: a <code>fillsize</code> and <code>fillskip</code>. Within a given
pattern, <code>fillsize</code> determines the size of each element in the
pattern, and <code>fillskip</code> the space between each element. </p>


<p> An example shape and pattern collection is
shown <a href="../examples/original-paper/example-pattern.eps"> here;</a> data
is available <a href="../examples/original-paper/example-pattern.data">
here;</a> it is made
using <a href="../examples/original-paper/example-pattern.py"> this
script.</a>
</p> 

<p> The last canvas method we describe
is <a href="postscript.html#text">text()</a>, which draws text onto the
screen. Most of its parameters are straightforward. However, the most crucial
argument to understand is the <code>anchor</code>. This parameter describes
how the text should be anchored relative to the coordinate that was passed to
the routine. The parameter takes the form of a comma-separated
string <code>'xanchor,yanchor'</code>, where xanchor specifies the anchoring
of the text in the x direction (either <code>l</code> for left, <code>c</code>
for center, or <code>r</code> for right), and yanchor the anchoring in the y
direction (<code>l</code> for low, <code>c</code> for center,
and <code>h</code> for high). The figure below shows the different
possible anchors (the coordinates passed to the text drawing routine are
highlighted with a red circle).

<h3> Programmability</h3>

<p> One of the major advantages of Zplot versus other plotting packages is
that the user simply writes Python. Thus, one can write functions and use code
to simplify the task at hand; one is not limited by some artificial
graph-specification language. </p>

<p> EXAMPLE WOULD BE GOOD HERE.</p>

<h3> Related Work </h3>

<p>
Zplot was a tool born of frustration
with <a href="http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/">gnuplot</a>. Gnuplot provides
excellent support for simple line graphs and scatter plots, as well as
numerous other graph types. However, its lack of reasonable support for bar
charts was one of the main driving forces behind Zplot. One positive of
gnuplot was its PostScript driver; the PostScript produced by gnuplot was
clear and easy to read, sparking an initial interest in that language, and
thus (indirectly) making Zplot possible. Great PostScript resources, for those
who are interested, are
the <a href="https://www-cdf.fnal.gov/offline/PostScript/BLUEBOOK.PDF"> blue
book</a>, <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/postscript/pdfs/PLRM.pdf">red
book</a>, and (to some extent),
the <a href="https://www-cdf.fnal.gov/offline/PostScript/GREENBK.PDF">green
book</a>; all are available online.
</p>

<p>
As Zplot was demonstrated to others, many people were reminded of
<a href="http://ploticus.sourceforge.net/doc/welcome.html">Ploticus</a>, which
is a more powerful and complete tool than gnuplot and is capable of producing
a large variety of interesting graph types. Many of the features found in
Zplot are also found in ploticus (e.g., a ploticus <code>area</code> is akin
to a Zplot <code>drawable</code>), and we often use examples from the Ploticus
web page to determine whether Zplot can easily do what Ploticus already
does. However, Ploticus is complex, and harder to modify, comprised of over
60,000 lines of C code. Zplot, in contrast, consists of a few thousand lines
of Python. This comparison is certainly unfair, as Zplot is not as powerful as
Ploticus, but the point remains.</p>


<h3> Conclusions</h3>

<p>
We have introduced Zplot, a pure Python library for drawing PostScript (and
SVG) figures. Zplot provides a number of powerful but simple tools for making
beautiful two-dimensional plots.  Dive into the <a href=".">documentation</a>,
